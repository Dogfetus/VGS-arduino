# High School Tasks

This repository contains a collection of tasks and projects completed during our high school education. The tasks were designed to help us develop various skills, including problem-solving, programming, electronics, and creative thinking. Each folder represents a specific task or project. This was uploaded a long time after actually doing the tasks, so there are no names or description of each task, but they were all there to help us understand how the arduino worked, and get started with coding.
